	Expected Output: None

./test2
	Tests: Attempting to call malloc after all memory is already in use, attempting to free null pointer, attempting to malloc memory that has been freed, leaving memory unfreed
	Expected Output: Alert user that requested amount of memory is not available, complain about null pointer, complain about exiting without freeing memory

./test3
	Tests: Attempting to allocate chunk of memory larger than the heap itself
	Expected Output: Alert user that requested amount of memory is not available

./test4
	Tests: Attempting to free pointer to dynamic memory that was not returned by malloc, attempting to free pointer outside of the heap

./test5
	Tests: Redundant freeing
	Expected Output: Complain about freeing already-free memory
